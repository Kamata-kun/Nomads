'''
Write a class to model a car. The class should:

1. Set the attributes model, year, and max_speed in the __init__() method.
2. Have a method that increases the max_speed of the car by 5 when called.
3. Have a method that prints the details of the car.

Create at least two different objects of this Car class and demonstrate
changing the objects attributes.
